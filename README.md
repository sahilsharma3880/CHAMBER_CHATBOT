# CHAMBER_CHATBOT
CHAMBER_CHATBOT is a secure, AI-powered conversational assistant built using Streamlit, LangChain, and Groq’s LLaMA 3.1 model. The application provides real-time, context-aware responses while maintaining a clean and interactive user interface. Designed as a full-stack project, it integrates frontend UI, backend logic, database management, and AI model orchestration into a single seamless system.

The project includes a complete user authentication system with Login, Registration, and Forgot Password functionality. Passwords are securely stored using SHA-256 hashing to ensure data protection. Each user has a personalized session, and chat conversations are stored persistently in the database, allowing users to retrieve previous messages even after logging out. This ensures a structured, secure, and continuous conversational experience.

On the AI side, the chatbot leverages LangChain’s structured messaging system (System, Human, AI roles) to maintain conversation context and improve response relevance. The integration with Groq’s ultra-fast inference API enables low-latency, intelligent responses suitable for study assistance, concept explanations, and interactive learning. The architecture follows a modular approach, separating database logic, authentication handling, and AI processing for scalability and maintainability.

This project demonstrates practical skills in full-stack development, API integration, authentication systems, secure data handling, database operations, and cloud deployment using Streamlit. It serves as a production-ready prototype for AI-driven applications that combine security, performance, and user-focused design.
